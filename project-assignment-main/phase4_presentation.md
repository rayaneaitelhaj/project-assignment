# Phase 4 – Project Presentation

## 🔹 Introduction

This project is a form-based web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective was to build a responsive form that validates user input, stores data, and provides a clean user experience. The development progressed through 3 main phases: planning, implementation, and further development.

---

## 🔹 Use Cases from Phase 1

### Planned Use Cases:
1. Fill out user form (name, email, phone)
2. Validate form fields
3. Display success message after submit
4. Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
5. Store user input in browser (localStorage)

### ✅ Implemented Use Cases:
- **All 5 use cases were fully implemented** and can be demonstrated live in the app.

## 🔹 Demonstration and Implementation

### ✅ 1. Input Form
- Users fill out their name, email, and phone number.
- The form checks for required fields, email format, and phone pattern.

### ✅ 2. Validation
- JavaScript prevents submission if email is missing "@".
- The phone number must be 10 digits.

### ✅ 3. Success Message
- A green "Thank you" message is shown on valid submit.
- The form is then hidden to prevent duplicates.

### ✅ 4. Responsive Design
- Layout adapts to mobile and desktop using Flexbox and media queries.

### ✅ 5. LocalStorage Integration
- On submit, the input is saved in localStorage.
- If the user reloads the page, the saved data is auto-filled.

## 🔹 Reflection

This phase-based workflow helped me understand how to structure a project. Every feature added in Phase 3 improved the usability.  
Dark mode, live preview, and localStorage made the app feel real and user-friendly.  
I also learned Git versioning, report writing, and how to follow multi-phase software development.

## 🔹 Future Ideas

If I continue this project, I would add:
- A backend (Node.js or Firebase) to store form data
- User login with password storage
- Admin view to manage submissions
- React version of the app with components
