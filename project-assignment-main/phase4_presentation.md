# Phase 4 – Project Presentation

## 🔹 Introduction

This project is a form-based web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective was to build a responsive form that validates user input, stores data, and provides a clean user experience. The development progressed through 3 main phases: planning, implementation, and further development.

---

## 🔹 Use Cases from Phase 1

### Planned Use Cases:
1. Fill out user form (name, email, phone)
2. Validate form fields
3. Display success message after submit
4. Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
5. Store user input in browser (localStorage)

### ✅ Implemented Use Cases:
- **All 5 use cases were fully implemented** and can be demonstrated live in the app.

## 🔹 Demonstration and Implementation

### ✅ 1. Input Form
- Users fill out their name, email, and phone number.
- The form checks for required fields, email format, and phone pattern.

### ✅ 2. Validation
- JavaScript prevents submission if email is missing "@".
- The phone number must be 10 digits.

### ✅ 3. Success Message
- A green "Thank you" message is shown on valid submit.
- The form is then hidden to prevent duplicates.

### ✅ 4. Responsive Design
- Layout adapts to mobile and desktop using Flexbox and media queries.

### ✅ 5. LocalStorage Integration
- On submit, the input is saved in localStorage.
- If the user reloads the page, the saved data is auto-filled.

## 🔹 Time Used (Estimation)

| Task                              | Hours |
|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Planning & Phase 1 documentation  | 3 h   |
| Form structure & validation       | 4 h   |
| Dark mode & responsive layout     | 3 h   |
| Live preview & success message    | 3 h   |
| LocalStorage & form hiding        | 2 h   |
| Testing, fixes, refactoring       | 2 h   |
| Writing reports & organizing Git | 3 h   |
**→ Total: ~20 hours**

## 🔹 Reflection

This project helped me learn how to structure a multi-phase web development process. Each phase added new layers of value:
- Phase 1 clarified the goals and design
- Phase 2 focused on functionality
- Phase 3 added polish and interactivity

I now understand how simple JavaScript features (like `localStorage` or `eventListeners`) can create real user value. I also improved my Git skills by managing all versions and folders correctly.

## 🔹 Future Ideas

If I continue this project, I would add:
- A backend (Node.js or Firebase) to store form data
- User login with password storage
- Admin view to manage submissions
- React version of the app with components
